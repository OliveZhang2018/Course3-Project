CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any
transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R: script used to perfom data cleaning and analysis as follows:
    (1) merges the training and test data sets into one set;
    (2) extracts the mean and standard deviation measurements for each measurement;
    (3) uses descriptive activity names to define the activities in the extracted data set;
    (4) appropriately labels the data variables;
    (5) calculates the average of each variable in the extracted data set for each activity and each subject. 

meanbyactivityandsubject.txt: a tidy data set with the average of
interested measures for each activity and each subject.
